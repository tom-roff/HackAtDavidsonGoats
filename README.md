<h1>🕰️ Borrowed Time </h1>
A rogue-lite platformer where players bet on themselves to complete various challenges against a ghastly gambler.

<h2>🎰 About the Game</h2>
In Borrowed Time, time is your most valuable currency. Players navigate treacherous levels deep in the Paris Catacombs, fighting off enemies while a constantly decreasing timer looms over them. To survive, you must bet on your own performance before each level—gambling for more time or greater rewards, but at the risk of losing it all.

<h2>🎮 Features </h2>

  -  Dynamic Betting System: Wager against the sinister Gambler NPC before each level to add buffs and debufs to your playthrough
  -  Time-Based Gameplay: A constantly draining timer keeps the tension high, only replenished through skillful play.
  -  Combat & Exploration: Fluid movement and combat mechanics, inspired by Hollow Knight and Grime.
  -  Stylized Art & Effects: A dark and immersive world brought to life with Blender, Substance Designer, and Figma.
